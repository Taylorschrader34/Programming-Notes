# Effective Development & Collaboration

Last class's exercise, I observed (or wanted to observe):

* Whiteboarding (via paper)
    * Understanding the problem by working out some examples
    * Diagramming possible designs and how they might work
    * Have a sketch of an idea before you even open your IDE
        * Blue prints come before bricklaying
        * Measurements come before you cut a piece of wood

* Prototyping and Design
    * Writing a function signature and documentation *first*
    * Allows you to identify design flaws *early*
    * Provides a road map to follow in implementation

* Elicitation
    * Fancy word for requirements gathering
    * Opportunity for clarification on the problem
    * Ask questions like "what should happen if..."
    * Client interaction
    * Rubber-duck debugging

* Peer Programming
    * Multiple eyes on the same code can help a lot
    * Multiple ways of thinking about a problem
    * Diverse set of perspectives

* Testing
    * Lots of ad-hoc testing (okay for now)
    * Long term: testing frameworks
        * Unit tests
        * Integeration Tests
        * Regression Tests
        * Acceptance Tests
        * Load Tests
        * "Chaos Testing"
    * Code coverage: what happens for a range of inputs?

* Bottom Line
    * Good communication:
        * Understanding others
        * Expressing yourself
    * Good collaboration is an *equal partnership*
        * Lab days: be sure to switch driving and navigating!
        * Don't undermine the learning experience of others
        * Don't undermine your own learning experience
